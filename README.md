# Serverless Framework Node Express API on AWS

## Usage

### Deployment

This example is made to work with the Serverless Framework dashboard, which includes advanced features such as CI/CD, monitoring, metrics, etc.

In order to deploy with dashboard, you need to first login with:

```
serverless login
```

install dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

and then perform deployment with:

```
serverless deploy
```

After running deploy, you should see output similar to:

```bash
Serverless: Packaging service...
Serverless: Excluding development dependencies...
Serverless: Creating Stack...
Serverless: Checking Stack create progress...
........
Serverless: Stack create finished...
Serverless: Uploading CloudFormation file to S3...
Serverless: Uploading artifacts...
Serverless: Uploading service aws-node-express-api.zip file to S3 (711.23 KB)...
Serverless: Validating template...
Serverless: Updating Stack...
Serverless: Checking Stack update progress...
.................................
Serverless: Stack update finished...
Service Information
service: aws-node-express-api
stage: dev
region: us-east-1
stack: aws-node-express-api-dev
resources: 12
api keys:

```

_Note_: In current form, after deployment, your API is public and can be invoked by anyone. For production deployments, you might want to configure an authorizer. For details on how to do that, refer to [http event docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/apigateway/).

### Invocation

After successful deployment, you can call the created application via HTTP:

```bash
curl https://xxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/
```


### Local development

It is also possible to emulate API Gateway and Lambda locally by using `serverless-offline` plugin. In order to do that, execute the following command:

```bash
serverless plugin install -n serverless-offline
```

It will add the `serverless-offline` plugin to `devDependencies` in `package.json` file as well as will add it to `plugins` in `serverless.yml`.

After installation, you can start local emulation with:

```
serverless offline
```

To learn more about the capabilities of `serverless-offline`, please refer to its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline).
